# Casio CZ-101 (1984)

## Overview
"The CZ-101 was the first and best-selling synthesizer in this line. Approximately 68,500 were manufactured. Released in November 1984, it was one of the first (if not the first) fully programmable polyphonic synthesizers that was available for under $500. In order to keep the price low, several compromises were made. The CZ-101 only had 49 keys (4 octaves from C to C) instead of the 61 keys most synthesizers had. Instead of full sized keys, the CZ-101 used miniature keys. It had pegs for a guitar strap so it could be worn, a compartment for 6 D-size batteries, and a headphone output but no internal speaker."
